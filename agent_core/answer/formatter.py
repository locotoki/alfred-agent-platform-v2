"""Citation Assembler & Answer Formatter.

Takes (query, retrieved_passages) and returns a dict:

{
  "answer": "<LLM-generated answer>",
  "citations": [
      {"id": <chunk_id>, "snippet": "...", "score": 0.89}
  ]
}

Current stub echoes the top-k passages; GPT call will be
added after ADR-013 is accepted.
